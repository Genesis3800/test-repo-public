This repo was made for the purpose of testing out a specific workflow.
The problem is that I work at an org where we want to have an open sourced docs repo,
but also want to have the ability to keep certain docs private.

Unfortunatlely, Github does not allow private PRs/branches on public repos.
So I am trying to set up a workflow b/w a public and a private repo that syncs the repo upon each commit.
